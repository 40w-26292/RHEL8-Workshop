= Web Console

[discrete]
== Overview

Web Console is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 web-based interface designed for managing and monitoring your local system.  The Web Console can also be extended to manage multiple servers located in your network.

Features of the Web Console include:

  * Managing user accounts
  * Managing and monitoring system services
  * Configuring network interfaces
  * Configuring firewall rules
  * Reviewing system logs
  * Managing virtual machines
  * Creating diagnostic reports
  * Setting kernel dump configuration
  * Configuring SELinux
  * Installing and Updating software
  * Managing System Subscriptions
  * more...

The following exercises will walk you through installing and configuring Web Console on RHEL 8. 

== Installation and Configuraiton

=== Packages and Services

For your convenience, the webconsole has already been installed and configured on *workstation.example.com*.  The steps for installation and setup are pretty simple and outlined below.  Remember this provided as reference only.

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to install and enable the Web Console_
----
yum install -y cockpit cockpit-dashboard firewalld
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
----
====

=== Custom Ports

By default, the Web Console listens on port 9090 of a host.  To make the system more accessible to students, an additional port of 443 was added to the configuration.  This was done by creating a systemd drop-in config:

./etc/systemd/system/cockpit.socket.d/listen.conf
----
[Socket]
ListenStream=443
----

This configuration change required a systemctl daemon-reload, selinux update and a firewall rule addition.  Remember this provided as reference only.

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to enable the Web Console on port 443_
----
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart cockpit.socket

semanage port -m -t websm_port_t -p tcp 443

firewall-cmd --add-port=443/tcp
firewall-cmd --add-port=443/tcp --permanent
----
====

That completes the installation and configuration of the Web Console.

== Web Console User Interface

Your instructors may provide you with a unique link with special instructions to access the web-console on *https://workstation.example.com* with your local browser. This is the PREFERRED method.

WARNING: You MUST enable "Reuse my password for privileged tasks" during sign-on.  If you did not, please log-off and start again.

Accept the various notifications about insecure ceritificates, and then login in:

  * UserID: root
  * Password: <ROOT-PASSWD-PROVIDED>
  * Enable "Reuse my password for privileged tasks"

Here is a simple dashboard where you can monitor current system performance:

  * CPU utilization
  * Memory Utilization
  * Disk I/O
  * Network traffic

== Enable Persistent Metrics

To enable persistent metrics collection, Web Console requires “Performance Co-pilot (pcp)” and the cockpit-pcp plugin.

If the user has sufficient priviledges, simply click on the link "Enable stored metrics.

A dialog will pop-up with basic notifications, go ahead and hit "Install".

Following the installation, there should be a toggle labelled `Store Metrics`, go ahead and click to enable and wait a few seconds for switch on.

That's it, now you can view the performance data over time including when you are not signed into the web console.

If you want to enable stored metrics by hand or plan to do so in a automation playbook, you can use follow the commands below.

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to enable stored metrics_
----
yum install -y cockpit-pcp
systemctl restart cockpit.socket
----
====

== Change Performance Profile

RHEL 8 comes with several pre-canned performance tuning profiles from Tuned. Since this is a virtual machine, the default profile “virtual-guest” was selected. You can easily switch profile via the Web Console web UI. In this exercise, we will change the profile to “throughput-performance”

== View Logs

Under the log section, you can review past and current log events and log severity

====

== Network Management

Under the networking section, you can monitor current networking activities. You can create network bond, team, bridge, and vlan driven by GUI

====

====

Also under the networking section, you can configure your firewall rules. In the following example, you will find and enable NTP firewall rule.

====

====

====
====

====

Now that NTP firewall rule is enabled. Let’s make sure NTP service is enabled and running under the service section

== Service Management

Web Console also allows you to start/stop, restart, enable/disable a service on your RHEL 8 server:

This concludes a short exercise with Web Console. Feel free to click through and explore other sections:

* Under *Accounts* section, you can manage user accounts on your RHEL 8 server
* *Diagnostic Reports* allows you to create sosreport for Red Hat support
* Under *Kernel Dump*, you can enable/disable kdump
