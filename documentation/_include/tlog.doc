= Session Recording with TLOG

== 

Starting on the host *workstation.example.com*, let's ssh over to *node1.example.com* as the user *student*.
Use the password provided by your instructors at the start of the lab.

.[root@workstation]#
----
ssh node1.example.com
----

Now chage your effective userid to student using the `su` command.

.[root@workstation]#
----
su - student
----

Notice the "ATTENTION" banner during your login.  Your session is being recorded!

[source,indent=4]
----
# ---------------
#  Host FQDN : node1.example.com
# OS Version : RedHat 8.0
# ---------------
Last login: Sat Apr 27 19:55:02 2019 from 10.0.0.10

ATTENTION! Your session is being recorded!
----

Let us now do a few activities worth logging.  You can check out a directory listing, look at the host's _passwd_ and _shadow_ files.  
Oh wait, you need root priviledges to see the contents of _/etc/shadow_.  You can use sudo for that!  Now exit your shell.

.[root@node1]#
----
ls -l ~

cat /etc/passwd

cat /etc/shadow

sudo cat /etc/shadow

exit
