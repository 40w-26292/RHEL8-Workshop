= Preface

This guide is intended to support a series of workshop exercises for individuals getting familiar with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

NOTE:  This whole effort is done using official Red Hat software and although things can likely be set up to work with upstream software components (Fedora, CentOS, etc...), alternate deritives of RHEL are not tested or validated with these exercises at this time.

= Conventions Used

== Tips, Notes & Warnings

TIP: Extra info which could be helpful, but not essential for a given task or discussion

NOTE: Special information to pay attention

WARNING: Critical information which could help you avoid major set backs

== Executing tasks on the CLI

=== Input

Each block of commands to execute will be label with the expected *user-id* and *host*.  To enhance cut & paste efficiency, the command prompt is omitted from each line.

.[root@master ~]#
----
systemctl status sshd
----

=== Output

Sample output will be titled with _'Your output should look like this'_ and also be indented to help with visual identification.  Sometimes there will also be footnotes and/or callouts.

.Your output should look like this

=== Alternate Commands

The workshop often provides scripts to ease certain tasks and reduce the chance for errors.  This helps the class stay on task and reduces the likelyhood of disruption to the workshop delivery.  The native commands which the scripts utilize will be documented in the following way.

.[root@master ~]#
----
cheat-validate-service.sh

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to verify POD service_
