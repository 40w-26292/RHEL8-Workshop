= LVM and VDO : Storage Management and Data Optimization

== Overview

Why use Logical Volume Management?

* Flexibility
* Grow, shrink or relocate your data/filesystems
* Aggregate or subdivide devices as needed
* Performance
* Striping across multiple devices
* Caching via SSDs
* Fault Tolerance (redundancy & resiliency)
* RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, 10
* Snapshots: Historical Recovery
* Data Optimization: Compression and De-Duplication

== Building Blocks of Storage Management

From the bottom up, here is a basic explanation of the layered technology stack that comprises modern storage.

|===
| File-systems    | Formatted LV's become filesystems
| Logical Volume  | A virtual storage device that may span multiple physical devices. Allocatable chunks (PEs) are assembled into “Logical Extents” that form the addressable space.
| Volume Group    | A collection of Physical Volumes that are divided into discrete allocatable chunks called “physical extents” (PEs).
| Physical Volume | An LVM concept that identifies physical devices for LVM use.
| Physical Device | Disks (IDE [hda], SCSI, SATA & SAS [sda], etc...)
                    Partitions (ex: hda1, sda1, cciss/c0d0p1, etc...)
                    LUNs (FCOE, SAN, etc...)
                    loopback

== Getting Started

Starting on the host *workstation.example.com*, let's ssh over to *node3.example.com*.  No password should be required.

.[root@workstation]#
----
ssh node3.example.com
----

Verify that you are on the right host for these exercises.

.[root@node2 ~]#
----
cheat-lvm-checkhost.sh
----

You are now ready to begin your exercises.

== Installation & Configuration

Install the required packages.

*Surprise!!!* There is nothing you need to install or configure for fundamental storage management.
