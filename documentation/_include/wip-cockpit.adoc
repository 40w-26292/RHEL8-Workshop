= Cockpit

Cockpit is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 web-based interface designed for managing and monitoring your local system, as well as Linux servers located in your network environment.

Managing services
Managing user accounts
Managing and monitoring system services
Configuring network interfaces and firewall
Reviewing system logs
Managing virtual machines
Creating diagnostic reports
Setting kernel dump configuration
Configuring SELinux
Updating software
Managing system subscriptions

The following exercises will walk you through installing and configuring cockpit on RHEL 8. 

== Installation and Configuraiton

Starting on the host workstation.example.com, let’s ssh over to *node2.example.com*. No password should be required.

.[root@workstation]#
----
ssh node2.example.com
----

Here are the steps to install and enable cockpit.  These are provided as reference only as they were executed during the ansible play of rhel8-workshop-prep.

.[root@node2]#
----
yum intall -y cockpit
systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
firewall-cmd —reload
----

== TASK 2

On host *workstation.example.com*, use the console GUI to start a web browser.

Then browse to URL: `https://node2.example.com:9090`

Here is a simple dashboard where you can monitor current system activities:
  . CPU utilization
  . Memory Utilization
  . Disk I/O
  .Network traffic

To enable persistent metrics, cockpit requires “Performance Co-pilot (pcp)” and cockpit pcp plugin. Follow the screenshots to install and enable persistent metrics.

RHEL 8 comes with several pre-canned performance tuning profiles from Tuned. Since this is a virtual machine, the default profile “virtual-guest” was selected. You can easily switch profile via cockpit web UI. In this exercise, we will change the profile to “throughput-performance”

Under the log section, you can review past and current log events and log severity

Under the networking section, you can monitor current networking activities. You can create network bond, team, bridge, and vlan driven by GUI

Also under the networking section, you can configure your firewall rules. In the following example, you will find and enable NTP firewall rule.

====

====
====

====

Now that NTP firewall rule is enabled. Let’s make sure NTP service is enabled and running under the service section

This concludes a short exercise with Cockpit. Feel free to click through and explore other sections:
Under ‘accounts’ section, you can manage user accounts on your RHEL 8 server
Diagnostic Reports allows you to create sosreport for Red Hat support
Under ‘Kernel Dump’, you can enable/disable kdump
