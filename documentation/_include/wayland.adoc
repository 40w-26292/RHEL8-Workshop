= Wayland

Wayland was first introduced to the Fedora community back in version 25. For several years, development, hardening and rich features have made Wayland the new standard in graphical desktop environments. (replacing X.org)

A detailed explanation of the architecture, functionality and features can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol) or you can simply go to the project’s homepage:  https://wayland.freedesktop.org/ for more details...

== Installation & Configuration

=== Packages and Services

The graphical desktop is included by default in a "Workstation" installation of RHEL 8, but this is not the case in a "Server" installation.

For today’s lab this has already been done for you, but in the event you installed a text based RHEL 8 host on your own you can load and enable Wayland with the following steps:

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to install Wayland_
----
yum groupinstall Workstation
 
systemctl set-default graphical

reboot
----
====

Log into the console of your workstation as the user *student*.
