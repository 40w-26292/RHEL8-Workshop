== Introduction

First of all, THANK YOU for registering and participating in *The Definitive Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Beta Hands-on Lab*.  The lab team has worked very hard to assemble a series of exercises to introduce many of the new features and capabilities found in the next great release of RHEL.  We hope you enjoy this experience and please don't hesitate to ask questions.

Also, please don't forget to review this session at the completion of this lab.  Your reviews and feedback help keep labs like these as top attractions for the Red Hat Summit.

NOTE:  This whole effort is done using official Red Hat software and although things can likely be set up to work with upstream software components (Fedora, CentOS, etc...), alternate deritives of RHEL are not tested or validated with these exercises.

== Conventions Used

This guide is intended to support a series of workshop exercises for individuals getting familiar with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.  What follows are examples of how this document is formatted and expected to be consumed.

[discrete]
=== Tips, Notes & Warnings

TIP: Extra info which could be helpful, but not essential for a given task or discussion

NOTE: Special information to pay attention

WARNING: Critical information which could help you avoid major set backs

=== Executing tasks on the CLI

[discrete]
==== Input

Each block of commands to execute will be labeled with the expected *user-id* and *host*.  To enhance cut & paste efficiency, the command prompt is omitted from each line.

.[root@master ~]#
----
systemctl status sshd
----

[discrete]
==== Output

Sample output will be titled with _'Your output should look like this'_ and also be indented to help with visual identification.  Sometimes there will also be footnotes and/or callouts.

.Your output should look like this
[source,indent=4]
----
● sshd.service - OpenSSH server daemon
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

     Docs: man:sshd(8)
           man:sshd_config(5)
 Main PID: 3094 (sshd)
   CGroup: /system.slice/sshd.service
           └─3094 /usr/sbin/sshd -D
...<snip>...
----
<1> This is the line we are interested in with a special note

==== Alternate Commands

The workshop often provides cheat-scripts to ease certain complex tasks.  This helps the class stay focused and reduces the likelyhood of errors and disruptions to the workshop delivery.  The native commands which the cheat-scripts utilize will be documented in the following way.

.[root@master ~]#
----
cheat-service-status.sh
----

[NOTE]
====
_Native command(s) to verify system service_
----
systemctl status sshd
----
